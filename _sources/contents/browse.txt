The graph shows recent sensor readings. The duration varies based on sensor types.
You can touch the graph to check sensor value at a point.

If you are using demo data generated by demo.py and do not see any data in this screen.
The generated demo sensor readings become too old. Run demo.py again to generate demo
sensor readings again.
