To keep track of relevant sensor information for the final decision on whether a user has time for a cup of coffee, you should declare four sensors on BuildingDepot : professorArrivalTimeSensor, cafeQueueLengthSensor, timeBeforeMeetingSensor and yourArrivalTimeToCafeSensor. Accordingly, you should replace the professorArrivalTimeSensor, cafeQueueLengthSensor, timeBeforeMeetingSensor, yourArrivalTimeToCafeSensor in both the AlexaSkill and the Dashboard with your own sensor ID.
