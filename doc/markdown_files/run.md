Run the Demo
=========================

This demo has two components: 1. Alexa Skills, 2. Dashboard, and 3. BuildingDepot. Before running the demo, make sure you've gone through the setup for 

[Uploading Alexa Skills to AWS server](https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/GrabCoffee/wiki/Uploading-Alexa-Skills-to-AWS-server)
[Setup Required Google APIs for Dashboard](https://github.com/IoT-Expedition/GrabCoffee/wiki/Setup-Required-Google-APIs-for-Dashboard)


Once you finished setting up on the Alexa Skill and the dashboard required APIs, you are good to run the demo. In the Dashboard directory on your PC, run 

`http-server -p 8000` 

and type localhost:8000 in the Chrome. 

One thing to note that you need to authorize the access to Google Calendar API the first time you run the demo.
